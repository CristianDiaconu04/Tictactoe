<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
<p> I created a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java for an 11th grade computer science assignment. At the time, I had no knowledge of OOP principles which definitely negatively impacted my code organization making it less efficient and harder to maintain. </p>

<h2> Tic-Tac-Toe Bot</h2>
<p> This game features a simple computer player which makes moves based on the following priority list:</p> 
<ol>
  <li> Winning moves </li>
  <li> Moves blocking the human player from winning </li>
  <li> Random moves </li>
</ol>
