<p> I created a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java for an 11th grade computer science assignment. At the time, I had little knowledge of OOP principles which definitely negatively impacted my code organization making it less efficient and harder to maintain. This program uses the given Board.java file which allowed me to implement the game logic without worrying too much about the GUI. </p>

<h2> Tic-Tac-Toe Bot</h2>
<p> This game features a simple computer player which makes moves based on the following priority list:</p> 
<ol>
  <li> Winning moves </li>
  <li> Moves blocking the human player from winning </li>
  <li> Random moves </li>
</ol>
